# Lingo.dev Community Contributions

Welcome to the official community space of Lingo.dev!

This directory is a dedicated space for community-driven projects, demo applications, and integrations that showcase what can be built with Lingo.dev.

**Note:** The code in this directory is for examples and educational purposes. It exists separately from the core Lingo.dev product source code. If you want to contribute to the core product (like the CLI, compiler etc), you can go through our or open new one.

## 📂 What belongs here?

We encourage you to submit projects that help others learn and build. Ideal contributions include:

* **Demo Apps:** Full-stack or frontend applications (e.g., React, Next.js) demonstrating specific Lingo.dev features.
* **Integrations:** Scripts or plugins that connect Lingo.dev with other tools in your stack.
* **Starters/Boilerplates:** Minimal setups to help new users get up and running quickly.
* **Tutorial Code:** Source code companion files for blogs or video tutorials.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

We love seeing what you build! To contribute to this directory:

1. **Fork & Branch:** Fork the repository and create a new branch for your contribution.
2. **Create a Directory:** Inside `community/`, create a new folder for your project. Please use `kebab-case` for naming (e.g., `community/react-todo-demo`).
3. **Add Documentation:** Every contribution **must** have its own `README.md` inside its folder explaining:

4. **Submit a PR:** Open a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch. Please tag your PR with `community-submission` so our team can spot it easily.
